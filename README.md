# My setup and config scripts
====

DO NOT USE THIS. IT DOES NOT WORK AND WILL LIKELY BREAK SOMETHING. I KEEP IT ONLY AS A REFERENCE.

These are just for me to set up my developer environment.
I do not intend for anyone else to use them.

But, feel free to look through them and use them as inspiration!
If you want to send me suggestions, feel free to do that as well.

However, I know that these aren't all perfect.
I just don't care to make them perfect, only I am using them.

They get executed in order:

- setup.sh is the base setup script. It calls the other scripts and does a few things on its own.

- repositories.sh adds all of the repos I use to the package manager.

- dotfiles.sh adds all of the dotfiles to the home directory.

- install.sh installs the packages I use

- env.sh sets up some environmental stuff that needs to be set, and installs some other things that needed to be installed.

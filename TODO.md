====

## Dotfiles

- Move the files out of dotfiles that don't need to be there.

## Setup Script

- testing
- do setup and installation of node, ruby, etc with RVM, NVM, etc in the setup script. (This will require sourcing RVM, etc, from within the setup script.)
- ~~alphebetize the installed packages to make them easier to manage~~
- setup nginx automatically
- Look into [RCM](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)

- break out the various parts into their own scripts

## Alternatives
